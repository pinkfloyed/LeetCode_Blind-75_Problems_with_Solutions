# Valid Palindrome

## Problem Statement

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.  

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
  - Output: `true`
  - Explanation: `"amanaplanacanalpanama"` is a palindrome.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `s = "race a car"`
  - Output: `false`
  - Explanation: `"raceacar"` is not a palindrome.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `s = " "`
  - Output: `true`
  - Explanation: After removing non-alphanumeric characters, `s = ""`, which is a palindrome.

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

## Approach

- Traverse the string and filter only alphanumeric characters.
- Convert all characters to lowercase.
- Reverse the filtered string and compare it with the original.
- If both match, it is a palindrome.

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  - Traverse + reverse operations.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
  - Extra space for the filtered string.
